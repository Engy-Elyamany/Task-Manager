 # üìù Task Manager
It's become a ritual for every programmer to build at least one to-do application in their career.This is my humble contribution to the tradition üöÄ
.However, i wanted to do something different . this is where i thought i would use bash scripting . It also comes with extra GUI for more fun and a user-friendly appearance üçü 


## üåç About
It is a To-Do Application where you can organise all your tasks in one place .
It is a task management tool which can suit everyone's lifestyle .Whether you are a
dedicated student or a busy professional you can find this program valuable thanks to its simple and straight-forward appearance and flow.

#### Built With 
I used bash scripting for this program . Since the intention was to build a user_friendly program i used " Zenity " for the GUI .


## ‚úÖ Features
The flow of the Program was designed with the intention  to help people with overwhelming tasks to take control back and be more organised.
That is why it is intended to be simple for easy and quick usage . 
These are the features in Task Manager :
- Add Task which includes setting the name , any notes or description , the date and the specific time
- View all your tasks in one place . You get an all-in overview of your schedule and tasks
- You get to choose which task to work on first in the order that suits your need
- finally , you get to mark tasks as "done" which will automatically delete that task from the data file.

## üéÆ Usage 
- You can check this video here " [[ Demo Video ]](https://youtu.be/-sGnicnuWCM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sGnicnuWCM)) " to understand my approach concerning the flow through the program.
- #### Data storage :
  As soon as you input your first task , a data storage file under the name " addtask_data.txt " will be created . This file will store all your tasks's data .

    Once you have marked the task as " done " , it will be deleted immediately from the file which will keep your task view  always updated.
